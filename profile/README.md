# Materializing Design 

Materializing Design is an ongoing research project housed at Concordia University in Montréal, led by Dr. Rilla Khaled and Dr. Pippin Barr.

Our major objectives are:

- To surface and materialise game design processes for an audience of academics, members of the game industry, design practitioners, and the game-curious general public
- To develop best practices and workflows for game makers to document, archive, and reflect on their work, aka the Method for Design Materialisation (MDM)
- To progressively build a set of public-facing online game development repositories, documented using MDM, supporting future research into game design practice
- To transparently employ grounded theory analysis to inform evidence-based patterns for how game design actually happens
